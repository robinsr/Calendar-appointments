# Calendar-appointments

Demo java microservice made with SparkJava.

This isn't meant to actually be useful. It's just a repo for me to tinker with java frameworks/libraries.

### TODOs

- [ ] Replace Spark with relevant framework for SDE role: Spring-boot, JAX-RS, Vaadin looks interesting
- [ ] DI of some kind. No static imports
- [ ] Add some form of data persistence
- [ ] Deploy with Docker and Ansible 
- [ ] Add Swagger annotations
- [ ] Add annotation-based timing metrics. Send to prometheus/grafana
- [ ] No groovy tests, switch to Junit 

### More functions (for fun!)
